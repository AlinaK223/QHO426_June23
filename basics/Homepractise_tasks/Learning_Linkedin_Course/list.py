#Here we have 4 variables:
#book1 = 'psychology'
#book2 = 'recipes'
#book3 = 'grammar'
#book4 = 'philosophy'
#comment them
#Below that I'll make a new variable
books = [
    'psychology',
    'recipes',
    'grammar',
    'philosophy',
]
#Now I could type a single value in th whole line, but it's much easier to read
#Don't forget to add coma at the end!
#So by grouping together my variables in the list, I organised my code and I made it clear that this values are related
