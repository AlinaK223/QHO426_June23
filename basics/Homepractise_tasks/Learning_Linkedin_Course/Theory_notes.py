#grouping multiple items and storing them with a single name, called variable
#Uses your code structure to indicate that mtiple pieces of data are related
#Avoids creating a potentially huge number of variables to track within our code
#Offers simplified syntax

#Introduction to iteration (often described as a loop)
#Loop - code that iterates, moving from the beginning to end of the process, then starting over, possibly 100 or 1000 times
#1 step - specify the data
#2 step - describe what should happen to the data during each iteration
#3 step - indicate when the loop should stop
#Infinite loop - bug that can occur whe the ending condition is omitted or specified incorrectly
